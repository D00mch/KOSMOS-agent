# AI Agent Tool Framework

A Kotlin-based framework for creating and managing tools that can be used with various AI models including Anthropic's Claude and GigaChat. This project provides a structured way to implement tool-based interactions with AI models, allowing for file operations and other system interactions.

## Features

- Tool-based interaction system supporting multiple AI providers:
    - Anthropic's Claude AI
    - GigaChat API
- Built-in file operation tools:
    - File reading
    - File listing
    - File modification
    - File creation
    - File deletion
    - In file text search 
- Extensible tool framework
- Interactive command-line interface

## Prerequisites

- Kotlin
- For Anthropic Claude:
    - Anthropic API key (set as an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable) - can be obtained from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
- For GigaChat:
    - GigaChat credentials (Authorization token required), [API page](https://developers.sber.ru/portal/products/gigachat-api).

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable
3. Build the project using Gradle:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Project Structure

- `src/main/kotlin/`
    - `anthropic/` - Anthropic agent implementation
    - `giga/` - GigaChat integration
        - `GigaAgent.kt` - GigaChat agent implementation
        - `GigaChatAPI.kt` - API client implementation
        - `GigaAuth.kt` - Authentication handling
        - `GigaToolSetup.kt` - Tool setup for GigaChat
        - `DTO.kt` - Data transfer objects
        - `GigaKtorClientDefaults.kt` - HTTP client configuration
    - `tool/` - Tool framework and implementations
        - `files/` - File operation tools
    - `Main.kt` - Application entry point

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

The application will start an interactive session where you can communicate with Claude AI. Type 'exit' to quit the session.

## Extending with New Tools

1. Create a new tool by implementing the `ToolSetup` interface:

```kotlin
interface ToolSetup<Input> {
    val name: String
    val description: String
    operator fun invoke(input: Input): String
}
```

2. Define the input parameters using a data class with `@InputParamDescription` annotations
3. Add the tool to the tools list in `Main.kt`

## Dependencies

- Anthropic Java Client: `com.anthropic:anthropic-java:1.0.0`
- Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous operations
- Jackson: For JSON processing
- Kotlin Reflect: For runtime reflection
